 	- I found the Simple_Shell project to be a very comprehensive task. It's design gave me and my partner creative freedom to tackle the tasks and at the same time confined us into using a number of specified system and function calls. The collaborative experience and the application of learnt concepts in C-sprint 2, was very enriching. In my opinion some of the key aspects to be keen on in order to have a less backbreaking experince when handling this project include;
	*Establing a proper plan and sequence of events before even attempting to code the shell
	*Understanding the functionality of key function and system calls such as execve, fork, wait, exit, free among others
	*Constantly checking memory leaks with every single new implementation. Memory leaks will really open for you the gates to sHell
	*Keep checking the performance of the shell each cycle of new implementation
	*Time management.
	*Most important of all;  Close collaboration and synegy with your partner

	- My gratitude goes to my partner Joseph, whom we worked closely around the clock to come up with this shell that can handle: ls, ls -flags, cd, env, pwd, exit, EOF, command separator, applied custom files among many other functionalities

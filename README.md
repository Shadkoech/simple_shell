# Unix Shell Implementation

The Simple Shell project reinforce the foundational C programming skills acquired throughout the course. This project involves the development of a basic UNIX command interpreter, commonly referred to as a shell. The shell allows users to execute commands and interact with the operating system, providing a practical application of system calls and process management.

## Key Concepts
In order to successfully complete this project, participants are expected to grasp the following concepts:

- **Unix Operating System:** Understanding the design and implementation of the original UNIX operating system.
- **Shell Basics:** Knowledge of the first version of the UNIX shell and its creator, Ken Thompson.
- **System Calls:** Familiarity with system calls and how they differ from regular functions.
- **Process Management:** Grasping concepts such as process IDs (pid) and parent process IDs (ppid).
- **Environment Manipulation:** Skills in manipulating the environment of the current process, including setting and unsetting environment variables.
- **Command Execution:** Learning how to execute commands using `execve` and managing processes effectively.
- **EOF Handling:** Understanding what EOF (end-of-file) signifies in the context of input and command execution.
- **Coding Standards:** Adhering to coding standards, including the Betty style guide, and ensuring code quality through testing and validation.

This project not only emphasizes technical skills but also encourages collaboration, problem-solving, and independent learningâ€”key attributes for any successful software engineer.
